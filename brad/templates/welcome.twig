                <p align="center" class="lead">Our purpose is to equip believers with a theological foundation so they
                    can grow in the knowledge of Christ to effectively reach their peers or communities with the
                    gospel.</p>
                <p>Serving in college ministry for fifteen years I agree with other prominent evangelical pastors and
                    leaders that Christians are starving for biblical truth.
                    Never before in the history of the world have more resources been available yet there are so many
                    misconceptions about God and the gospel.
                <blockquote class="blockquote"><strong>What is the result?</strong><br>A watered down gospel,<br>an
                    easy-believism theology, and<br>a misunderstanding of the doctrine of God.
                </blockquote>
                Living in a college town, my ministry focus includes a focus on international college students and young
                adults. College students come to East Carolina from all over the world.
                My prayer is that these international students will believe the gospel, become equipped in biblical
                theology, communicate the foundational doctrines of Christianity effectively,
                and become trained to use their gifts to effectively reach others in their home countries.</p>
                <p>In-Depth Studies is also a resource to Christians who want to grow in their theological development
                    which includes discipleship, speaking opportunities, skype meetings, and writing bible study
                    material.
                    In addition, our ministry has partnerships internationally in Canada, Czech Republic, Austria,
                    Romania, Great Britain, Mexico, and Belarus.
                    We partner with local churches in these countries to equip pastors, campus ministries, and lay
                    leaders.
                    As a result, these churches are effectively reaching their communities, sending missionaries, and
                    planting churches globally. </p>
                <p>My prayer for our ministry is the same as Paulâ€™s in Ephesians 3:17-19: <em>that you being rooted and
                        grounded in love,
                        may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height
                        and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge,
                        that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</em></p>
